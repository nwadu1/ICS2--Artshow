I changed the titles and texts on each scene. I changed the background of each scene. I removed the multiple squares
in the middle and replaced it with an image of a cat. I inserted the image offscreen by multiplying mouseX and mouseY by 3 so when the 
mouse gets dragged to the text, the viewers will get a surprise. I changed the circle on the mouse to a rectangle and changed the
colour to pink. In the last scene I inserted another image of a meme with text saying "You got scared didn't you".
